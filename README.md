##Overview##

This project outlines the design and documentation for the use of datasets regarding Garda Stations in Fingal.
These datasets are found at data.gov.ie, at the following [https://data.gov.ie/dataset/garda-stations] (LINK ADDRESS HERE).
This API is designed for the development of mobile apps. To provide Fingal residents with information on where and how to contact their local guarda Station in the event of an emergency. This data can be also be useful for use at other times however. Such as by local Schools wishing to arrange Garda required events.
